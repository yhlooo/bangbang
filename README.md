# BangBang

BangBang is a decentralized face-to-face group chat and file transfer tool that allows multiple clients in the same local area network (LAN) to pair by entering the same PIN code.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central server required, all communication happens directly between peers
- **PIN-based Pairing**: Simply enter the same PIN code to connect with multiple clients
- **Real-time Chat**: Face-to-face group chat with multiple participants
- **File Transfer**: Share files directly between connected clients (TODO)
- **LAN Discovery**: Automatic discovery of other clients on the same network
- **Terminal-based UI**: Clean and intuitive terminal interface

## Installation

### Docker

Run using the Docker image [`ghcr.io/yhlooo/bang`](https://github.com/yhlooo/bangbang/pkgs/container/bang):

```bash
docker run -it --net=host --rm ghcr.io/yhlooo/bang:latest --help
```

### Binaries

Download the executable binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/yhlooo/bangbang/releases) page, extract it, and place the `bang` file into any directory in your `$PATH`.

### From Sources

Requires Go 1.24.7 or later. Execute the following command to download the source code and build it:

```bash
go install github.com/yhlooo/bangbang/cmd/bang@latest
```

The built binary will be located in `${GOPATH}/bin` by default. Make sure this directory is included in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

### Starting a Chat Session

To start or join a chat session, use the `chat` command with a PIN code (e.g., `7134`) :

```bash
bang chat 7134
```

All participants who use the same PIN code will be connected to the same chat room.

#### Network Discovery

BangBang uses UDP with multicast address (default: `224.0.0.1:7134`) to automatically find other clients on the same LAN. The discovery can be customized using the `--discovery-addr` parameter.

#### Logging

- By default, logs are output to stderr
- In chat mode, logs are discarded unless debug mode or verbosity is enabled
- When debug mode or verbosity (level 1+) is enabled in chat mode, logs are saved to `~/.bangbang/bang.log`

### Other Commands

#### Scan for Available Rooms

```bash
bang scan
```
